Installation
------------
	double click on index.html in the public folder. User friendly ! :)

Usage Examples
--------------
General:
	Shots each iteration is how many shots you need to do before the game tells you what are hits and what is a miss.

	The game ends when:
			- Total shot is zero OR
			- You have sunk all ships

	A ship is sunk when you have hit all the squares of a ship, this is also the time when you recieve money for sinking the ship ('see' a ship as software and you only get revenue with finished software). 

Testing
